  <h1>Closer look at objects</h1>
  <p>*Every JS object has prototype property which makes inheritance possible in JS</p>
  <p>The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit
  </p>
  <p>The constructor prototype property is NOT the prototyle on the constructor itself, it's the prototype of ALL
    instances that are created through it</p>
  <p>When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found ,
    the search moves on the object's prototype. This continues until the metod is found: prototype chain. </p>
